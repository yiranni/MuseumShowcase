                                During the last quarter of the first century A.D. and the early decades of the
                                second
                                century
                                A.D.,
                                ever more complex hair arrangements were developed for the ladies of the
                                imperial
                                court.
                                Hairpieces with added hair and concealed frameworks
                                formed high diadem-like structures surrounding the face. One of the most
                                elaborate
                                constructions
                                appears on the official portraits of Marciana,
                                the elder sister of Trajan. The high polish and engraved eyes on this head
                                suggest
                                that
                                it
                                was
                                carved during the Hadrianic period.
                                The powerful women of Trajan’s family were much honored by his successor,
                                Hadrian,
                                who
                                is
                                said
                                to have owed his throne to their influence.
                                Marciana was the grandmother of Hadrian’s wife, Sabina.

                                The bronze Boxer at Rest, also known as the Terme Boxer or Boxer of the Quirinal, is a
                                Hellenistic Greek sculpture of a sitting nude boxer at rest, still wearing his caestus,
                                a type of leather hand-wrap. It has been given various dates within the period of about
                                330 to 50 BC. It was excavated in Rome in 1885, and is now in the collection of the
                                National Museum of Rome, normally displayed in the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.

                                The Boxer at Rest is one of the finest examples of bronze sculptures to have survived
                                from the ancient world; survivals from the period are rare, as they were easily melted
                                down and transformed into new objects. The work comes from a period in Greek art where
                                there is a movement away from idealised heroic depictions of the body and youth, and an
                                exploration of emotional themes and greater realism.
